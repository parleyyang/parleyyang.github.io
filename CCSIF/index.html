In these uncertain and difficult times, what do the next few years hold for us, and how will this impact us as investors looking to outperform the market? Parley has an intriguing medium run forecast of the British economy, titled “An inflationary trajectory towards a capitalistic social reform”. He will explain in detail the rationale behind such a projection, followed by a portfolio review of CCSIF’s current holdings, and suggestions for which FTSE 350 stocks the Fund should acquire.
