<h3>
My talk on the 28th January 2021: 
<br><u>
The limitation of artificial intelligence: attacks and defences
</u>
<br>
</h3>
I offered this talk as part of the first year online social series, where students talk about their ongoing or past research.
<br>
There I gave a short overview of my PhD research, covering three key topics of interests. <a href="Notes/21Jan.pdf"> Notes can be found here </a>, and the video will be uploaded soon.
