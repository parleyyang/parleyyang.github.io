My research report and slides, presented to the  <a href="https://www.ccimi.maths.cam.ac.uk"> CCIMI </a> on the 7th June 2021: 
<br><u>
Instabilities in statistical modelling and a proposal of the adaptive learning method in time series
</u>
<br>
Abstract:<br>
We investigate the instabilities in statistical modelling and propose an innovative learning
method in time series. In the first half of the report, we start by reviewing the overarching
idea of stabilities and statistical learning in a regression setting, followed by their relations
to linear models. Then, we present studies towards the gradient of the linear models
and neural network models, followed by distributional analysis. The second half concerns
specifically with the topics in time series: stationarity and forecasting. By reviewing
the contemporary methods with computational experiments, we analyse the stability and
instability of some autoregressive models. Lastly, we propose a forecast-centric learning
method called adaptive learning.

N.B. I noticed some typos and mistakes on the page 8. A newer version will be pushed to Arxiv with these mistakes corrected.

My poster on the 20th May 2021, presented in the <a href="https://gateway.newton.ac.uk/event/tgmw92"> The Flip Side of the Pandemic: Recent Advances in the Mathematics of Information	</a>: 
<br><u>
	Adaptive Learning on Time Series: Theory and Practice
</u>
<br>
Abstract:<br>
Modern data science deals with high-dimensional modelling and prediction. Adding to that complexity, time series data possesses its unique properties --- time-varying relationships and autocorrelation --- due to the nature of the time. Working from a forecasting-centric standpoint, we propose a novel learning regime for time series analysis:  <u> adaptive learning</u>. In this poster, we present the contemporaries from the works we have done [7,9,10] and that we are currently engaging in [11].
