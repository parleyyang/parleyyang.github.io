<br><u>
	Adaptive Learning on Time Series: Theory and Practice
</u>
<br>
Abstract:<br>
Modern data science deals with large dimensional modelling and prediction. On top of those, time series has its unique properties --- time-varying relationships and autocorrelation --- due to the nature of time. Working from a forecasting-centric standpoint, we propose a novel learning regime on time series, <u> adaptive learning</u>. In this poster, we collect and present the contemporaries from the works we have done [7,9,10] and to be done [11].

My talk on the 28th January 2021: 
<br><u>
The limitation of artificial intelligence in finance: attacks and defences
</u>
<br>
I offered this talk as part of the first year online social series, where students talk about their ongoing research.
<br>
There I gave a short overview of my PhD research, covering three key topics of interests.
